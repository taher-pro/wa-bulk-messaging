The Alumni of MSB worldwide are proudly called *Hizb us Saifiya til Burhaniyah*, not only because they have spent foundation-days of their lives in MSB Educational Institute, but because they still hold the values that they have acquired here closely guarded in their hearts, on their faces, in their Deeni Shi'aar, in their actions, in their words and most importantly in their thoughts.

With Raza Mubarak of *Aqa Maula* TUS *Hizb us Saifiya til Burhaniyah* committee has been appointed in all the centres and they participate in various khidmats and activities.

MSB Bangalore is further structuring its HSB family. To keep all its members abreast of the latest happenings, it is imperative to have a strong and effective communication system.

In the coming days we will be gradually inviting HSB members who have shared their contact information with us in the survey.
To streamline group management we request you to please *not share* the invite with other HSB members. We are in process to build a registration system for HSB members and we will be inviting HSB members on this platform in the coming days.
